    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef neck is one of my favorite meat meals. It is full of proteins and healthy
        fat which gives you energy. Althought it is super foodstuff you should not eat
        it too much. It could make your cholesterol go high. Any way beef neck is one 
        of my favorite foods, and it is okay to eat it twice a week.
    </p>
    <p>Beef neck can be made various ways, imagination is the only limit. I like it 
    simple, so mostly I grill the neck with as little spices as possible. It can be made
    grilled rare, medium rare, medium, medium well or well. Personally I like it most when 
    it's medium well or well.
