    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carp on Fork is traditional Croatian fish food. It is coming form Baranja county 
        where it is real atraction on metings named "fishijada". I have to admit that this 
        is the best served fish meal I have tried so far. I highly recommend it.
    </p>
    <p>Carp on Fork is best made with wild carp, which have better meast with less fat.
        Preparation is very short, but time needed to bake the fish is a little bit long.
        Althought it takes long to bake the fish it is totaly worth it. The fish it self 
        can be served with any side dish you like the most. My favorite is bean salad.
